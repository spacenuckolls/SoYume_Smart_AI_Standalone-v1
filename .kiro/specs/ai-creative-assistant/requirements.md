# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SoYume AI Creative Assistant is a next-generation, modular AI system designed specifically for creative writers, story developers, and neurodivergent users. It serves as both a standalone desktop application and an embeddable plugin for creative writing platforms, with a focus on offline-first operation, universal accessibility, and deep contextual understanding of narrative structures, characters, and creative writing processes.
